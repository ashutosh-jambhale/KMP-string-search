Methods:
main: Entry point that handles command-line arguments, either displaying the skip table or searching a file for the pattern.

buildSkipTable: Constructs a skip table (partial match table) that stores how far to skip when mismatches occur during searching.

calculateSkip: Computes the skip value for a specific character at a given pattern position by finding matching prefixes.

printSkipTable: Displays the skip table with pattern characters as headers and skip values for each character.

kmpSearch: Searches text for the pattern using the precomputed skip table to optimize comparisons.

searchInFile: Reads a file line-by-line, searches each line for the pattern, and prints matching lines with their positions.

Example of how this code works:
Command: java KMPsearch "marmot" FiftySentences.txt
Steps:
1)Builds skip table for "marmot".
2)Reads FiftySentences.txt line by line.
3)For line "a marmot should chase the quick wolf". Finds "marmot" starting at position 3.
Output: 3 a marmot should chase the quick wolf.

4)Continues through entire file.
